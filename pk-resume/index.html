            <h2>Oh, A Bit About Me? If I Must...</h2>
            <p>First of all, I can't STAND not being able to control line spacing and margins in css right now. Absolutely going bonkers. Bonkers. Really, I must learn this first. First, I say.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I'm a graphic design generalist based in Chicago. Even though I've heard people say that being a generalist can be bad, I can't imagine being something else. For as long as I can remember, I've seen the world as a series of interconnected events. The more I learn about how everything works, the better product I can build and the richer story I can tell. The generalist life is the life for me! And this is why I'm a designer in a front-end web development class, loving every minute so far! Except for the line spacing and margins, at the moment.</p>
            <p>Third, I'm a bit impatient. Why can't we just download knowledge like in <i>The Matrix?</i></p>
